Pong is a popular 2d game that I will remake to improve my Godot skills with game dev. Hope you like it!
This project is part of the things I learned from  [Clear Code - Learn Godot by creating Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr1BoEbuveI), a really good tutorial that gave me the introduction to Godot Engine. In my project I added some things by myself and made some changes like:
+ Game Over Screen

>## Technologies
+ Godot Engine
+ GDScript

## Game Screenshot

+ GDScript programming
+ Sounds in the game
+ Game Over
+ Basic AI
+ Player motion
